/**
 * One row per refused request for a module a society does not own.
 *
 * ## Why this is stored at all
 *
 * The gate returns a bare 404, which is right — a 403 is a product catalogue
 * for anyone mapping the platform. The cost is that support will one day stare
 * at a 404 on a route that plainly exists and have nothing to look at. This is
 * the thing to look at.
 *
 * ## Why it is read as a sales signal, not a security one
 *
 * The overwhelmingly likely explanation for a society repeatedly hitting
 * Amenities routes is that somebody at that society wants Amenities. Treating
 * that as an intrusion attempt reads the signal exactly backwards. The alert
 * this feeds is shaped like a lead, and its primary action is "Grant Amenities".
 *
 * ## Retention
 *
 * 90 days. Long enough to see a pattern across a billing cycle and answer a
 * support question about last month; short enough that we are not accumulating
 * a behavioural record of named individuals indefinitely, which is exactly the
 * open-ended retention the offboarding work exists to close.
