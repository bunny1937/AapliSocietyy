/**
 * <SetupGate> — the end of dead ends.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Wrap any accounting page. It asks /api/accounting/setup-state what is
 * missing and, when the page cannot work yet, renders the reason and a button
 * that goes to the exact screen where the missing thing is created — instead
 * of the page body.
 *
 * ## What it replaces
 *
 * Five pages each carried their own version of:
 *
 *     <EmptyState text="No Financial Year found"
 *                 hint="Create a Financial Year under Accounting first." />
 *
 * Three problems with that, in increasing order of seriousness. It is not
 * clickable. It uses a word ("Financial Year") without saying what one is. And
 * it named a place — Accounting — that did not exist in the navigation, so the
 * instruction could not be followed at all.
 *
 * ## Two modes, deliberately different
 *
 * BLOCKING — the prerequisite this page needs is missing. The page body is not
 * rendered. Showing a working-looking screen that will reject every action is
 * worse than showing why it cannot work: the person fills a form, presses
 * save, and gets an error that arrives too late to teach them anything.
 *
 * ADVISORY — the prerequisite is satisfied but something later in the setup is
 * not. A strip appears above the page and the page works normally. This is the
 * "you are on page 3 and page 2 is half done" case: worth saying, never worth
 * blocking on, and dismissible so it does not nag someone who has decided to
 * come back to it.
 *
 * ## Why it fetches rather than being handed props
 *
 * The alternative is every page fetching setup state and passing it down,
 * which is the same duplication in a new place. One component, one request,
 * one vocabulary. Pages that already load their own data are unaffected — this
 * runs alongside.
 *
 * See docs/accounting-guided-ux/00-plan.md §3.
