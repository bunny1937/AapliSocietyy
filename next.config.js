      //
      // 10mb was misleading. Vercel rejects any request body over 4.5MB at the
      // edge, before the function runs — this setting cannot raise that ceiling,
      // it only relaxes Next's own additional check. Declaring 10mb meant the
      // codebase advertised a limit it could never honour, which is exactly how
      // the "upload just fails with no error" bug survived so long.
      //
      // 4mb sits safely under the platform limit, so oversized bodies now fail
      // with our own error message instead of a bodyless platform 413.
      // Anything larger must use the presigned direct-to-R2 flow
      // (POST /v1/uploads/sign) which has no such ceiling.

// SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN is set — that's expensive enough to OOM a `next build`

// its build environment and has the RAM for it; a local build doesn't set
// that var, so it gets the plain, unwrapped config instead. Runtime error
// capture (instrumentation.js / instrumentation-client.js) is unaffected —
