/**
 * Statements workspace — four tabs, one route. Design doc §12 Phase 4/5's
 * route shrink: this used to be four separate pages
 * (/admin/generate-statements, /income-expenditure, /assets-liabilities,
 * /other-statements). Each tab is that same PageClient mounted unchanged —
 * it still fetches its own data against its own permission-gated API, so a
 * role with only one of the four underlying view permissions still reaches
 * this page and simply finds only that tab loading real data.
 *
 * Exported as `StatementsWorkspace` (not just the page's default) so the
 * Auditor workspace's "Statements" tab (design doc §8) can embed the exact
 * same four tabs read-only, rather than re-implementing them.
 *
 * Old routes now redirect here with `?tab=` set (see each folder's page.js).
