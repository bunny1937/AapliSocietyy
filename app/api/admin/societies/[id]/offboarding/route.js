// POST /api/admin/societies/:id/offboarding — the actions on the offboarding

//
// Only one so far, and it is the one that matters: waiving the handover gate.
//
// Gate 6 of society-purge refuses to erase a society that has not collected
// its own copy. That is right almost always, and unsatisfiable in one real
// case — a dissolved committee whose registered address bounces. The schema
// has carried `handoverWaivedAt` for exactly that since the gate was written,
// and nothing in the product could set it, so the only escape from the
// deadlock was editing Mongo by hand.
//
// It is deliberately not a flag. Purging a society that never received its
// records is a judgement call, so it is recorded as one: who decided, when,
// and on what grounds. The reason is mandatory and stored.
