// The module catalogue, as data.
//
// Everything that gates a module reads this file: the API guard, the page
// guard, the sidebar, the mobile app's /v1/me payload, the coverage script and
// the grandfather migration. One definition, six consumers.
//
// ## Why a registry and not a check per route
//
// The likeliest way module gating fails is drift — a route added in month six
// that nobody remembers to gate, quietly serving a feature the society never
// bought. Scattering `if (society.features.amenities)` through two hundred
// handlers guarantees that outcome. A registry makes "which routes belong to
// Amenities" a fact one file can answer, which is what lets
// scripts/check-entitlement-coverage.mjs fail the build on an ungated route.
//
// ## Prefix matching is deliberate, and deliberately narrow
//
// A module claims path *prefixes*, not patterns. `/api/v1/amenities` covers
// every route beneath it forever, including ones not written yet — which is
// the point. But it also means a prefix must never be broader than the module:
// claiming `/api/v1` for anything would swallow the whole platform.
//
// ## RBAC is deliberately absent, and must stay absent
//
// "Advanced Access Control" used to be module 5 here, claiming /api/rbac/roles,
// /api/rbac/permissions, /api/rbac/assignments and /admin/rbac. It has been
// removed permanently. Two reasons, in order of weight:
//
//   1. Auditor and Treasurer are statutory offices under the MCS Act and the
//      model bye-laws. Every registered society must have them. Gating the
//      roles was gating compliance, which is not ours to sell.
//   2. There is no cost to recover. A Role doc is ~2 KB and a RoleAssignment
//      ~0.5 KB; the difference between a society running 7 roles and one
//      running 12 is ~20 KB. Across the whole platform that is single-digit
//      megabytes. Metering it would have been a price with no cost behind it.
//
// Role *scoping* (a role valid only for one wing, gate or financial year) is
// the one access-control feature worth money. It does not exist yet, and when
// it does it belongs to a size-based plan tier — not to a module gate here.
// Do not re-add an `rbac` entry. Re-gating a feature already given away costs
// more trust than never having given it.
//
// See docs/subscriptions-module-docs/00-plan.md for the reasoning behind which
// modules exist and why Accounting is not one of them.
