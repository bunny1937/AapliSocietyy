/**
 * AapliSociety Accounting — opening the books, one visible step at a time.
 * ============================================================================
 * SERVER ONLY.
 *
 * ## What this replaces
 *
 * /api/accounting/quick-setup does six things in one call — Financial Year,
 * 57 chart-of-account heads, the fiscal account mappings, posting rules,
 * validation rules, schedules — and returns `{ ready: true }`. The admin sees
 * a two-second spinner and one green tick standing in for six subsystems. If
 * a piece half-fails there is no way to tell which, and nobody learns what any
 * of it was.
 *
 * Same work, same order, same idempotence — but each step runnable on its own
 * and each one reporting what it actually did.
 *
 * ## Why the steps are the shape they are
 *
 * `fiscalConfig` is its own step even though quick-setup buries it inside the
 * accounts block. It is the step that tells the system WHICH account is the
 * cash account — without it a recorded payment has nowhere to post, and the
 * failure surfaces much later as a bill that will not settle. A hidden step
 * that breaks something distant is exactly the kind of thing this page exists
 * to stop hiding.
 *
 * ## The contract every runner keeps
 *
 * Idempotent: running twice must be a no-op the second time, because a person
 * watching a step fail will press it again. So each returns what it created
 * AND what it skipped — "already there" is a result worth showing, not
 * silence.
 * ============================================================================
