/**
 * AapliSociety Accounting — the standard Chart of Accounts
 * ============================================================================
 * The account heads a statutory Maharashtra co-operative housing society
 * Balance Sheet and Income & Expenditure statement actually print. Schedule
 * codes follow §6.3 of docs/accounting-system-ARD.md.
 *
 * Lifted out of app/api/accounting/quick-setup/route.js on 2026-08-27. It had
 * been defined inside that route and exported from it, which meant anything
 * else needing to know "what a fully set-up society looks like" had to import
 * from a route handler. The setup-state service needs exactly that list to
 * report which heads are missing, and the guided setup (Phase 3) needs it to
 * say what it is about to create — so it belongs in lib/, with the route as
 * one consumer among several.
 *
 * See docs/accounting-guided-ux/00-plan.md.
