// This is the mobile counterpart of lib/amenities/apiHelpers.gate(): gate()
// authenticates a website cookie session, this authenticates a mobile Bearer
// token, and both end at the same RBAC leaves. It exists because the two auth
// surfaces genuinely differ — not to introduce a second permission system.
//
// Deny-by-default, twice over:
//   1. resolveEffectivePermissions() returns an EMPTY set on any failure, so an
//      RBAC lookup that errors refuses the request instead of waving it through.
//   2. Every route names the capability it needs, and a capability with no leaf
//      in CLUBHOUSE_PERMISSION_BY_CAPABILITY can never be satisfied here. That
//      is the mechanism, not a convention: MANAGE_CAPACITY has no entry, so no
//      clubhouse route can ever be written that changes a capacity.
//
// Hiding a button in Flutter is not authorisation. This is.
